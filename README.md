Software development is my dream.

I’ve always been a great problem solver, individually, or in groups and I always had an obsession with computers. I remember assembling my first PC at the age of 7 and that peaked my interest. Today I am a qualified developer with backend and frontend skills.

I started learning to code when I was a teenager, through different courses at school. This lead me to the University of the West Indies: Cave Hill Barbados, where I completed my Bsc in Software Engineering. 

During my tenure at the university, I worked as an intern developer for a local company in Barbados, Taylor'd Technologies. I also completed a remote internship with Yick Solutions LTD in China, where I completed two individual projects. Since then, I’ve started server-side development as a trainee with Wiley Edge to develop my backend skills.

I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including ReactJS, Svelte, HTML, NodeJS, Golang, CSS, and Java to name a few. However, I’m always willing to learn and add new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
