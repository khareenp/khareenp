### 🚀 About Me

I’m passionate about building secure, scalable software and automating infrastructure.
My love for technology began at **7**, when I assembled my first PC — a spark that grew into a career in software engineering and cloud development.

Today, I’m an experienced **Software Engineer & DevSecOps professional** with a BSc in Software Engineering from UWI Cave Hill and a master’s in progress at Boston University (MS in Computer Information Systems). I enjoy tackling complex problems, mentoring peers, and contributing to meaningful projects across web, mobile, and cloud platforms.
